Write a function which, given a linked list, returns whether that linked list contains a cycle.

E.g., given the following linked list, your function will say "yes, this contains a cycle".

```
               E
            /  ^
          v    |
A -> B -> C -> D
```

That is, where traversing would result in `C -> D -> E -> C -> D -> E`
