## General Approach

1. Find the base case(s),
2. Have your function recognize the base case(s) and provide a solution,
3. Recursively define a solution to the sub-problem for other inputs,
4. Call your function on the input and print the result to STDOUT.

## Things to think about

Although we are doing this mainly to learn recursion, think about whether
this is effecient in your language of choice. Does your language support tail
call elimination?
