How many different ways can you make change for an amount, given a list of coins?
In this problem, *your code* will need to efficiently compute the answer.

# Problem Statement

Write a program that, given two arguments to STDIN  
* a list of coins `c1, c2, c3, ..` 
* and an amount `n`

Prints out how many different ways you can make chnage from the coins to STDOUT.

**The problem can be formally stated:** 

Given a value `N`, if we want to make change for `N` cents, and we have infinite supply of each of `C = { C1, C2, .. , Cm}` valued coins, how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.

**Example 1:**

For `N = 4` and `C = {1,2,3}` there are four solutions: `{1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}` 

So given the input
```
1, 2, 3
4
```
your program should output:
```
4
```

**Example 2:**

For `N = 10` and `C = {2, 5, 3, 6}` there are five solutions: `{2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}`

So given the input
```
2, 5, 3, 6
10
```
your program should output:
```
5
```


# Solving the overlapping subproblems using dynamic programming

You can solve this problem recursivly, but you will not passs all the tests unless 
you optimise your solution to eliminate the [overlapping subproblems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_subproblem) using a [dynamic programming solution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming)

Or more specifically; 
* If you can think of a way to store the checked solutions this store can be used to avoid checking the same solution again and again.

# Hints

* Think about the degenerate cases:
   - How many ways can you give change for 0 cents? 
   - How many ways can you give change for >0 cents, if you have no coins?


* If you are having trouble defining your solutions store, then think about it in terms of the base case `(n = 0)`
