# Problem Statement
How many different ways can you make change for an amount, given a list of coins?

The problem can be formally stated: 

Given a value `N`, if we want to make change for `N` cents, and we have infinite supply of each of `S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm}` valued coins, how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.

# Hints
Think of the degenerate cases:

   * How many ways can you give change for 0 cents? 
   * How many ways can you give change for >0 cents, if you have no coins?
